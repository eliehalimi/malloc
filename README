This file is aimed at giving you some understanding of the program.

This program is used for creating a wrapper capable of allocating memory
efficiently.


To compile it use either:

    make
    make all

To compile it using debug flags:
    make debug


To run some tests:

    make test


To run the program, use either one of the following syntaxes:

    LD_PRELOAD=libmalloc.so <PROGRAM_NAME>


These commands have the same syntax as told in the subject (subject to whether
they have been implemented or not (cf. TODO)).


To clean everything created by the 'make' function do:
    make clean


Thank you for reading
